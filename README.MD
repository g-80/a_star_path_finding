# A\* path finding algorithm

This small program finds the shortest path between two selected points and draws it. It uses pygame for displaying the gui.

### Requirements

- Python3
- Pygame (python external library)

### Using the algorithm
1. Run the python file.
2. Choose a starting point (grey square), then an end point (orange square), then draw barriers (black squares).
3. To edit any square, right click on the square.
4. Press `Space` to find the shortest path.
5. Press `C` to clear the grid and start again.
